    "# Fourier Transform Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Basic Concept\n",
    "The Fourier transform converts a signal from the time domain (where it's typically measured) to the frequency domain. This allows us to see what frequencies are present in the signal and their relative strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Continuous Fourier Transform\n",
    "For continuous signals, the Fourier transform is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $F(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform (a function of frequency $\\omega$)\n",
    "- $f(t)$ is the original signal (a function of time $t$)\n",
    "- $e^{-i\\omega t}$ is the complex exponential that allows us to analyze different frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)\n",
    "For discrete signals (like those in digital systems), we use the DFT:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi kn/N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $X_k$ is the $k$-th frequency component\n",
    "- $x_n$ is the $n$-th time sample\n",
    "- $N$ is the total number of samples\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Interpretation\n",
    "- The Fourier transform essentially \"projects\" the signal onto sine and cosine waves of different frequencies.\n",
    "- The magnitude of the Fourier transform at a particular frequency tells us how much of that frequency is present in the original signal.\n",
    "- The phase of the Fourier transform tells us about the timing or offset of these frequency components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Applications\n",
    "- Signal analysis: Identifying dominant frequencies in a signal\n",
    "- Filtering: Removing unwanted frequencies (like noise)\n",
    "- Compression: Representing signals more efficiently in the frequency domain\n",
    "- Image processing: Analyzing and manipulating images in the frequency domain\n",
    "- Communications: Modulating and demodulating signals\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Inverse Fourier Transform\n",
    "We can also convert back from the frequency domain to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform, allowing us to reconstruct the original signal after performing operations in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform is particularly useful in biomedical engineering for tasks like analyzing ECG signals, processing medical images, and filtering noise from biological signals."
