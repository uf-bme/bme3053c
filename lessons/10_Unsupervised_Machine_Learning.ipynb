        "\n",
        "Unsupervised machine learning refers to a type of machine learning where the model learns from unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, there are no target labels for the model to predict. Instead, the model identifies patterns and structures within the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of unsupervised learning is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data. Since the data is unlabeled, the model must determine relationships and groupings without any guidance. Unsupervised learning is particularly useful when we do not know what we are looking for in the data or when we want to explore the data to find inherent groupings or reduce complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types of unsupervised learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Clustering**: Grouping data points based on similarity. Clustering algorithms attempt to find clusters or groups of similar data points in the dataset. This can be useful for customer segmentation, market research, and understanding natural groupings within data. Examples of clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in the dataset while retaining important information. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data that can be difficult to visualize or analyze. Dimensionality reduction techniques help in compressing data, removing noise, and making the analysis more efficient. Examples of dimensionality reduction techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Factor Analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common applications of unsupervised learning include clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. In this lesson, we will explore five popular unsupervised learning techniques: **k-means clustering**, **hierarchical clustering**, **DBSCAN**, **principal component analysis (PCA)**, and **t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)**.\n"

        "1. You want to discover hierarchical relationships in your data\n",
        "   - Exploring taxonomies (e.g., biological species classification)\n",
        "   - Understanding organizational structures\n",
        "   - Analyzing social networks\n",
        "2. You don't know the number of clusters beforehand\n",
