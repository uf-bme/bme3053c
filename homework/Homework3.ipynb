        "Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method used to measure the oxygen saturation (SpO2) level in the blood. The device measures the absorption of light at two wavelengths (usually red and infrared) to estimate SpO2. One of the challenges in pulse oximetry is identifying and analyzing peaks in the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, which corresponds to the heartbeats.\n",
